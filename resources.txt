k-neighbors clustering using image embeddings: https://keras.io/examples/vision/semantic_image_clustering/


Clustering versions:

Initial choices:
Photos with aspect ratios similar 3:2 (landscape)
Randomly samples from within larger categories to create equal classes

Version 1:
DomainNet/real + /paintings + Food101
- Bird, Building, Cold-Blooded, Fashion, Ground_transport, Household, Mammal, Music, Nature, Office, Plants, Sport, Tool, Travel, food, painting
- 300 per category
- Travel consists of Sky and Water travel
- Sub-cats same as paper
    - dropped 'diamond', 'flying saucer', 'map', 'calendar', 'passport', 'stitches', 'nail', 'wheel', 'bandage'
- USER ERROR: food_dir had duplicate painting images, hence version 1 preference to paintings and painting duplicates
ResNet 18 embeddings pre-trained
Dot matrix similarity 
    - 16 clusters (16 image directories)
    
Version 2:
DomainNet/real + Food101 + Flowers
- Bird, Cold-Blooded, Ground_transport, Household, Mammal, Nature, Office, Plants, Sport, Travel, food, flower
- 600 per category
    - 300 in plants and sports
    - 500 in Birds
- sub-cats shifted among categories
    -dropped same as above plus domainnet flower subcat
ResNET
dot matrix similarity
- 12 clusters

Version 3:
Return to version 1 without the user error and with seed(30) or non-random subsampling. The purpose of this version was two-fold:
- to create and test consistent photo saving (as near as possible). For example with the same given cat and subcat inputs the same photos will be saved in the same order each time.
- To explore/create quantative evaluation framework using class labels and model prediction
[Note: must redo neighborhood evaluation with change in evaluate_image_sim code]

Version 4:
Return to version 2 with seed(30) or non-random subsampling and method of evaluation
